This is an advanced user example adapted from the work 'Grover’s Algorithm: implementation in cQASM and
performance analysis' by bachelor students David Bakker, Hitesh Dialani, Rembrandt Klazinga and Maurits van der Tol. The 
work was received as part of the Quantum Science and Quantum Information minor, TU Delft.

The work can be found in PDF format in the current folder (docs/sat_example/Grover's Algorithm.pdf)

The original code as written by the students can be found at https://github.com/FluffyToaster/QuantumGrover. The code
is slightly altered, and large pieces are removed that were not relevant for the example.

See https://www.quantum-inspire.com/kbase/code-example-sat/ for an introduction to the example.
